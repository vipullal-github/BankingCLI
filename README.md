# Bank Command Line Interface

Develop command line interface (CLI) to simulate interaction with a retail bank. Implement the following 
commands:

| Command                           | Description                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------|
| login `<client>`                  | Login as `client`. Creates a new client if not yet exists.    |
| topup `<amount>`                  | Increase logged-in client balance by `amount`.                |
| pay `<another_client>` `<amount>` | Pay `amount` from logged-in client to `another_client`, maybe | 
|                                   | in parts, as soon as possible.                                |

Your code should handle edge cases and be covered with tests.
Please document your assumptions.

## 'Pay' Command Examples

Given clients Alice and Bob with initial balances (100, 80):

| Action               | Result Balances                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bob pays Alice 50    | (150, 30)                                              |
| Bob pays Alice 100   | (180, 0) with Bob owing 70                             |
| Bob tops up 30       | (210, 0) with Bob owing 40                             |
| Alice pays 30 to Bob | (210, 0) with Bob owing 10. Debt has further decreased |
| Bob tops up 100      | (220, 90)                                              |
